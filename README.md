Field Trip is an open source documentary about an unconventional place: Tempelhof Field - an airfield in the heart of Berlin metropolis. Field Trip tells the story of what, for some, is a 300 hectare free urban paradise, for others a place of forced labour, and for yet more a safe haven. By using the technique of open hypervideo and intense on-site and online community development, Field Trip aims at becoming a living documentary.
